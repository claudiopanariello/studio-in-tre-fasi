# Studio in Tre Fasi

Studio in Tre Fasi (Study in three phases) is an adaptive site-specific sound installation that includes 22 solenoids placed on metallic arches that surround visitors and react to environmental perturbations, creating a self-regulating soundscape of metallic hits that serves to renew the visitorsâ€™ acoustic perspective. Adaptivity is a crucial aspect of the work: Similar perturbations will not generally cause similar reactions from the installation based on past interactions, thus allowing evolution over time to play a key role artistically and technically. This article discusses the author's position on adaptivity in music interaction and composition and reports on the technical and artistic aspects of the installation.

This repository containts the code of the installation.
